    <h1>Answer 1</h1>
    <P> The primary difference between an argument and a parameter is that
      a parameter is a variable or set of variables in a method. The argument
      is simply the actual input value of the parameter. You would use a parameter
      when the data is unknown yet or the argument must be entered by the user.
      Arguments can be used if there is no variation and the values are already known.</p>

    <P> Void in a method declaration indicates that there will be no output,
      whereas return indicates that there will be some value output at the end of
      the method.</p>

    <P> When you include "import java.util.Scanner" it allows you to include
      the Scanner.nextInt(), nextDouble() or next(), which allows the program
      to input strings, doubles or integers into the program. "Java" in
      java.util.Scanner is the folder "util" is inside the java folder and "Scanner"
      is inside the "util" folder and is used for inputting values.</p>

    <P> A while loop and do while loop are very similar, with the primary difference
    being that a do while loop requires the conditional statement to be st the end
    and a while loop is declared before it begins. A for loop is primarily used for
    loops that have a set number of loops before ending. </p>

      <p> You typically use .equals for String variables, comparing two Strings
      together, giving them a true value if they are the same, and a false value
      if they are not. == is used to compare integers or doubles, while = is used
      formally assaign a value to a variable. </p>
